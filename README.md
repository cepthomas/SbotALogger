# SbotALogger

A simple logger for use by the sbot family of plugins. It works in conjunction with `def slog(str, message)` in
`sbot_common.py`. If this plugin is imported, slog() uses it otherwise slog() writes to stdout.

Built for ST4 on Windows and Linux.

- Intercepts the ST console write and copies to a file.
- Adds timestamp and (three letter) category.
- If the category appear in `notify_cats`, a dialog is presented. Those in `ignore_cats` are ignored.
- The 'A' in the name enforces loading before other Sbot components.
- Log files are in `%data_dir%\Packages\User\.SbotStore`.

## Exceptions

These are the categories of exceptions in the Sublime python implementation:
- User-handled with the standard `try/except` mechanism.
- Plugin command syntax and functional errors are intercepted and logged by a custom `sys.excepthook` in `sbot_logger.py`.
- Errors in scripts that are executed by sublime internals e.g. `load_module()` are not caught by the above hook but go straight
  to stdout. It *works* but is not as tightly integrated as preferred.
