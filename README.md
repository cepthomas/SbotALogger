# SbotALogger

A tool to make debugging plugins a bit easier.

- Intercepts the ST console write and copies to a file.
- Adds (optional) timestamp.
- Examines the first word to identify as a user supplied category. These are fixed at
  four characters to match the slog(cat, message) function in [SbotCommon](https://github.com/cepthomas/SbotCommon).
  SbotCommon.slog() is not required but works nicely with this plugin.
- If the category appear in `notify_cats`, a dialog is presented. Those in `ignore_cats` are ignored.
- Captures unhandled exceptions (e.g. ST internal) and notifies the user. This is done once - assumes you have to go fix your problem before continuing.
  Note that this doesn't show up until the current view loses focus.
- The 'A' in the name enforces loading before other Sbot components.


Built for ST4 on Windows and Linux.
