# SbotALogger

- The 'A' is to force this to load first so logging is set up early.
- Intercepts the console write and copies to a file.
- Adds optional timestamp.
- Examines the first word to identify as a user supplied category. These are fixed at
  four characters to match the log_message(cat, message) function in [SbotCommon](https://github.com/cepthomas/SbotCommon).
- If the category appear in `notify_cats`, a dialog is presented. Those in `ignore_cats` are ignored.
- Displays the stack trace from unhandled exceptions once (assumes you have to go fix your problem before continuing).


Built for ST4 on Windows and Linux.
